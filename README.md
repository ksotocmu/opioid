## About
This repository holds my project for the _altREU_ program: Computational Models Serving Communities, conducted at Portland State University. I developed machine learning models to forecast the risk of opioid overdoses and deaths in Pennsylvania. 

#### Detailed information as well as model predictions can be found at the project website: https://ncarolan.github.io/opioid/.

## Assistance
Special thanks to project advisor Dr. Wayne Wakeland, as well as program director Prof. Christof Teuscher, and MacKenzie Gray.
