Predicting and preventing opioid overdoses with machine learning

## About
This is my project for the _altREU_ program: Computational Models Serving Communities, conducted at Portland State University.

I am developing machine learning models to forecast the risk of opioid overdoses and deaths in the 67 counties of Pennsylvania.
